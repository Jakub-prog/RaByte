### Why Use Tailscale on the Jetson?

Tailscale is a VPN that allows secure, private connections between devices on different networks. By setting it up on the Jetson, you’ll be able to access and manage the Jetson remotely, even if it’s not on the same Wi-Fi or local network. This setup is especially useful if you want to control the Jetson from anywhere without complex network configurations.

### Step 1: Create Your Own Tailscale Network

Before setting up Tailscale on the Jetson, you’ll need to **create a Tailscale network using your own device and account**. This will ensure that all your devices, including the Jetson, are connected under the same secure network.

1. **Install Tailscale on Your Personal Device**:
    - Go to the Tailscale download page and install Tailscale on your primary device (e.g., your laptop or desktop).

2. **Set Up Your Account**:
    - Open Tailscale on your device and sign in using an email account (Google, Microsoft, or GitHub recommended).
    - This account will be the "owner" of your Tailscale network, so choose an email you control.
3. **Activate Your Device**:
    - After logging in, Tailscale will set up a private network, and your device will be the first member.

### Step 2: Install Tailscale on the Jetson

Once your network is created on your primary device, you can install Tailscale on the Jetson and connect it to the same network. This way, both devices will see each other and can communicate securely.

## Linux
**Install Tailscale** on linux (**jetson**):

- Download and install Tailscale using the official method:
  
```bash
  curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh
```

Start Tailscale Service: After installation, start the Tailscale service:

```bash
sudo tailscale up
```

**Authenticate with Tailscale**:

- When you run `tailscale up`, it will provide a URL for authentication.
- Open the URL in your web browser, and log in with your Tailscale account to authorize the Jetson device.

**Verify Connection**: After authentication, your Jetson will be connected to your Tailscale network. To check the connection status, run:

```bash
tailscale status
```

This command will show you the list of devices connected to your Tailscale network, including your Jetson.
