2. [ROS 2 Installation](Jetson/help/ros2installation.md)
3. [Checks for CUDA, TensorRT, and OpenCV](Jetson/help/Checks-for-Cuda-TensorRT-and-OpenCV.md)

## SSH and IP Problems

- [Finding the IP Address in the Network](Jetson/help/Finding-the-IP-Address-in-the-Network.md)

### Embedding Sections

Instead of Obsidian-style `![[...]]` embedding, use direct links or copy the relevant sections here on GitHub, as embedding doesnâ€™t work. You can manually link or refer to those sections like this:

- [Setting up Tailscale for Remote Access](jetson/help/Setting-up-Tailscale-for-Remote-Access.md)
- [ROS 2 Installation](jetson/help/ros2installation.md)
- [Checks for CUDA, TensorRT, and OpenCV](jetson/help/Checks-for-Cuda-TensorRT-and-OpenCV.md)
