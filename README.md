## Installation

1. [Setting up Tailscale for Remote Access](Jetson/help)
2. [ROS 2 Installation](jetson/help/ros2installation.md)
3. [Checks for CUDA, TensorRT, and OpenCV](jetson/help/Checks%20for%20CUDA%2CTensorRT%20and%20OpenCV.md)

## SSH and IP Problems

- [Finding the IP Address in the Network](jetson/help/Finding%20the%20IP%20Address%20in%20the%20Network.md)

### Embedding Sections

Instead of Obsidian-style `![[...]]` embedding, use direct links or copy the relevant sections here on GitHub, as embedding doesnâ€™t work. You can manually link or refer to those sections like this:

- [Setting up Tailscale for Remote Access](jetson/help/Setting%20up%20Tailscale%20for%20Remote%20Access.md)
- [ROS 2 Installation](jetson/help/ros2installation.md)
- [Checks for CUDA, TensorRT, and OpenCV](jetson/help/Checks%20for%20CUDA%2CTensorRT%20and%20OpenCV.md)
